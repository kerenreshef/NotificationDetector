## Future Improvements:

1. Load Balancing: Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers or instances to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded. 
2. Multithreading: Add a mechanism of threadpool and messaging queue in order to improve each server ability to process multiple events asynchronously.
3. DataBase: Add a database to save important information. For example: information about warnings.
4. User Interface: Add a user dashboard to view the detection warnings in a prettier way.
